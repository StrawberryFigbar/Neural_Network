# Neural_Network
This is a Neural Network project of mine, using mnist and cifar datasets to test

## Running
To run this Neural Network choose one of the files and set up the fully connected layers, activation functions, and softmax layer if preffered. Then just run either the ```fit``` or ```batch_fit``` functions to train the network and the ```predict``` function to use the network to predict values

## Working On
I am still working on implementing stochastic gradient descent as well as mini-batch gradient descent. I continue to try to add and optimize my loss and activation functions as well.
